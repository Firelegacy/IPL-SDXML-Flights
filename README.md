# Project realized as part of our Data structures/XML courses at IPL

Project where you read an XML file containing all the airports in the world with their coordinates, full and abbreviated names. Second file contained actual flight connections available. 
We then stored the data into java objects which were themselves stored in collections. 

We had to build three algorithms to find the shorter paths + one bonus :
- BFS : Breath first search
- DFS : Depth first search
- Dijkstra : Shortest path
- (Bonus) Dijkstra with penalities : preference towards flights done by the same airline company.
